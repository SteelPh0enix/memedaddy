# Markos
A sassy German/American bot, made for discord. He hates his owner, Melmsie.

Well, he doesn't hate him. He just doesn't care much for him.

Markos has a very... confusing personality. Sometimes he will tell you you look beautiful, sometimes he will tell you to F*** yourself. 

We [the developers] don't control how he responds to you in most cases. It's up to him, we apologize.

The words in his vocabulary grow as you interact with him [and as fast as we can type them into his word arrays], so be careful what you say to him.
